When accessing the YouTube TV interface, you may encounter this error message:
<img src={disappointing} />

This is a user agent based restriction, and can be circumvented by changing your browser's user agent to a television.

> This is the User-Agent that you need later (or at least the part that matters).
> Copy all of it (including `;`) for now.

> `; Tizen 2.4`
