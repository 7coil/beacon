## Uses
- Use screen sharing to share VLC Media Player to share your content
    - Audio will also be shared with other members in the voice channel!
- Use screen sharing to show off your work in Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome!
    - Audio unfortunately no longer works with Google Chrome, and has never worked for Mozilla Firefox.
- Show off what you are playing
    - The _Go Live_ feature does not allow you to see what others are playing
    - This is a reasonable workaround against that limitation

## Installation
1. Enable Developer Mode in the settings
    - `Appearance` > `Developer Mode` (at the bottom)
2. Join the Voice Channel
3. Right click any message, and _Copy Message Link_
4. Paste the link in the chat box
5. Right click the voice channel you are in, and _Copy ID_
6. Paste the ID you just copied where the second number is
7. Delete the third number
8. Send the link, and click the link
    - Other members can also click the link to join you in the voice channel you copied the ID from
    - That link will work forever for that specific voice channel
       - You will need to join the voice channel before you reuse the link
