With obvious exceptions such as Netflix, other HDCP protected content, and some 3D accelerated applications, you can stream most Windows applications with audio to Discord.
This works by streaming an entirely new desktop inside a Remote Desktop Connection window.

## Setting Up

To begin, you will need the following:

- Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 Professional (or above)
    - If you have Home, you can try anyway, but it probably won't work. I haven't tried
- About 10 minutes of your precious life

## Instructions

1. Download the `RDP Wrapper Library` from the [rdpwrap GitHub page](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap/releases)
    - Windows will most definitely define the zip as a malicious file.  
      You need to keep the file anyway in your web browser.  
      Ask it very nicely to keep your file.

2. Extract the files and run the `install.bat` file as an Administrator.
3. Open the `RDPConf.exe` file.
    1. Set the `Authentication Mode` to `GUI Authentication Only`
    2. Untick the `Single session per user` checkbox.

4. Search for `Remote Desktop Connection` in the Start Menu, and type in `127.0.0.2`.  
   Change the display resolution to one that's reasonable.

5. Click connect and make sure everything is working before you continue.
6. Create an empty folder.
7. Inside that empty folder, create a folder for your locale.
    - If your display language is `English (United Kingdom)`, call it `en-GB`
    - If you're a Canadian, try `en-CA`
    - If you're not sure what your code is, try this:
        1. Search for `cmd` in the Start Menu, and start it as an administrator
        2. Run `bcdedit`, and find the line that reads `locale`
            - This is your locale code.
8. Go to `C:\\Windows\\System32\\` and copy `mstsc.exe` to the first empty folder.
9. Whilst still inside the `System32` folder, find the folder with your locale name, and copy the file inside the folder called `mstsc.exe.mui` to the second empty folder.
    - Here's one I prepared earlier
    - <img src={foldersGif} />
10. Inside the first empty folder, run `mstsc.exe`, and connect to `127.0.0.2`
11. Go to Discord, and add `127.0.0.2 - Remote Desktop Connection` to your list of games.

Congratulations! You should now be able to stream almost anything into Discord, with audio.

--------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------
1               | Are you trying to hack me? This is a virus!!                                   | I'm not trying to.
2               | What does this do?                                                             | It allows people to connect to your computer remotely. You are doing it so you can connect to yourself. Remember to reopen `RDPConf.exe` and disable the feature after you are done, and re-enable it when you need it again.
4               | Why do I have to do this step?                                                 | You can't change the configuration anywhere else easily elsewhere. If you know how to do it easily, please send a GitHub pull request or a message on Discord.
7               | What about if my language is English (United States)                           | `en-US`
10              | Wait why am I connecting again with this `mstsc.exe` instead of the first one? | The second one doesn't allow you to change settings (for some reason)
11              | I'm scared of hackers                                                          | Reopen `RDPConf.exe`, and uncheck the `Enable Remote Desktop` checkbox. You can now rest.
